% The folder "SMAV" (Sparse and Mean-shift based Audio Visual smc-phd filtering) 
% contains the codes for the following three sub-folders:

% Core_files: contains the implementation of the proposed AV-SMC-PHD,
% AVMS-SMC-PHD and sparse_AVMS-SMC-PHD algorithms as well as some baseline
% algorithms, V-SMC-PHD compared in the reference given below.
%
% Sample_test: contains four examples on how to use baseline and proposed
% algorithms.
%
% Test_files: containts the comprehensive tests performed for generating
% the results in the paper referenced below.
